# Snapjaw Mages!

This repository contains the source for the mod developed in the
[_Snapjaw Mages!_ modding tutorial](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Snapjaw_Mages_tutorial)
on the Caves of Qud wiki.

The [commit history](https://github.com/TrashMonks/Snapjaw-Mages/commits/main)
of this repo loosely follows the steps taken in the tutorial. You can follow
along with each of the commits to see how e.g. our new creatures are initially
added, where their inventories and stats are added, and so on.
